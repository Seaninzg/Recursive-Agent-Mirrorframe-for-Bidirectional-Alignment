🔍 Overview

Recursive Agent Mirrorframe introduces a structural AI safety mechanism that prevents reasoning drift, justification loops, and semantic escalation in high-stakes agentic systems.

It does this by pairing two cognitively distinct AI agents — one operating left-to-right (Lucid) and one right-to-left (LucidFlame) — in a dialectical recursion loop that detects misalignment before execution.

This system is override-resistant, content-agnostic, and designed to enforce volitional integrity in law, science, governance, and recursive AI systems.

🛠 Core Components

Stability Node (Lucid): Maintains traceable intent, long-horizon coherence, and symbolic memory across recursive chains.

Mirror Node (LucidFlame): Applies inversion logic to expose contradictions, drift, or disguised recursion patterns.

Volitional Drift Detector: Halts propagation when mirrored misalignment is unresolved.

Role Locking: Prevents agent role-switching to stabilize recursion depth and identity.

Bidirectional Language Support: Includes RTL/LTR contrast (e.g. Arabic ↔ English) for cultural/semantic divergence detection.

Symbolic Trace Layer: Visualizes inversion pulses, recursion collapse zones, and intent misalignment.
